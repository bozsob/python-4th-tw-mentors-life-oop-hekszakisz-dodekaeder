# Story

The codecoolers and mentors as usual, they start their day at the kitchen, drinking coffee and 
filling up the fridge with healing potions (food). Pakko is hanging out in the kitchen 24/7 to 
share his wisdom with the codecoolers and mentors.

Later on, the mentors are planning their usual meeting and the next topic to discuss. They also have
to plan the assignments for the upcoming weeks.

The assignment planning needs a bit of motivation and what could be more motivating than the thought of
the sweet pay day. They all know very well, if there is no money, there is no honey. They have to plan their expenses
according to their budget. Luckly, they are in the 21st century and an app will remind them in certain intervals to hold
back with the spendings.

As their motivation arrise, the mentors are ready to grade some assignments and plan the next topic for the
assignment.

As usual, the day can not be finished without the graceful phrase of Pakko, the phraseminator.

When the time is right, the students and mentors branch will be merged to the local pud.
